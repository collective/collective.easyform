Collective.easyform enables creation of custom forms using dexterity. This Plone package is similar to Products.PloneFormGen that is based on Archetypes. Dexterity is a new platform for content types in Plone and will be used instead of Archetypes in Plone 5. Easyform provides a Plone form builder through-the-web using fields, widgets, actions and validators.

Similarly to PloneFormGen, Easyform is used to generate web forms that save or mail form input. Simple and user-friendly interface allows non-programmers to create custom forms. 

Usage
=====

* Install product (in your buildout.cfg add ‘collective.easyform’ to the eggs section), rerun your Plone instance and activate Collective.easyform. 
* Choose Easyform from the 'Add new' drop-down menu. Insert form title, description and other settings.  
* Add fields or fieldsets to create a unique form that will meet your particular requirements.  There are enough basic field types to satisfy any demands: File Upload, Text line (String), Integer, Yes/No, Date, Date/Time, Floating-point number, Choice, Rich Text, Image, Multiple Choice, Text, Password, ReСaptcha field. 
* Continue to customize form by setting the order of fields, defining required and hidden ones, choosing validator, if necessary, and other field type specific settings.
