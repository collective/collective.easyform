  [thomasmassmann]


1.0a4 (2020-11-17)
------------------

NOTE: if you deploy 1.0.4+, the easyform extended validations start working again on fields
in extra field sets (they only worked on the main/default fields). This could cause some
issues if those validators, or default values, were misconfigured in the first place.

New:

- Add 'easyform-thankspage' css class to the content-core div if the thankspage is
  displayed. Combined with the header_injection field you can style elements
  only for the thankspage, for example as a workaround to remove empty
  fieldsets (#154). [fredvd]

- Move the default xml configuration out into xml files. These can be picked up
  by ``i18ndude`` or other po file generators for translations strings. Also
  translate the ``FIELDS_DEFAULT`` fields.
  [thet]

- Add German translations.
  [thet]

- Allow the definition of some EasyForm default values via the i18n translation
  mechanism.
  [thet]

- Reworked mail address formating, avoiding recipient address in the form of
  ``name <<account@domain.com>>`` and having instead
  ``name <account@domain.com>``.
  [thet]

- Depend on plone.schemaeditor > 2.0 for JS compatibility.
  [thet]

Fixes:

- For increased security, in the modeleditor do not resolve entities, and remove processing instructions.
  [maurits]

- Fixed validation, inline validation, and defaults for fields in fieldsets.
  Refs issues `#172 <https://github.com/collective/collective.easyform/issues/172>`_
  and ` #157 <https://github.com/collective/collective.easyform/issues/157>`_. [frevd, maurits]

- Fix inline validation. Backport for 1.x from #59 . Possibly also closes #5 (running spinner). [tomgross, fredvd]

- Fixed errors with ``header_injection`` implementation. [maurits]

- Add missing ``header_injection`` implementation. Backport for 1.x from #152. [krissik, fredvd]

- Fixed filtering of fields on thanks page and mailer template.
  We show the correct fields now.  In the mailer, the order is also what we selected.
  [maurits]

- fix plone.schemaeditor i18n factory import. This fixes 5.0.1 support

- Reverted some Plone 5 fixes that prevented collective.easyform from working
  anymore on Plone 4.3, in particular some modals/overlays. [fredvd]

- Pin to plone.schemaeditor 2.0.7 in setup.py, lower and higher versions break
  on Plone 4.3. See #30 [fredvd]
