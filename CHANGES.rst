2.1.1 (2019-11-18)
------------------

NOTE: if you deploy 2.1.1+, the easyform extended validations start working again on fields

issues if those validators, or default values, were misconfigured in the first place.

- Let ``filter_fields`` return fields in the correct order.
  This fixes the order on the default mailer template.
